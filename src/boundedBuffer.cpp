/**
 * @brief Constructs a bounded buffer with a fixed capacity.
 *
 * This constructor creates an instance of a BoundedBuffer, allocating the internal storage for
 * up to N elements of type T. It initializes the state variables and the thread synchronization
 * required to safely manage concurrent access to the buffer.
 *
 * @tparam T The type of elements stored in the buffer.
 * @param N The maximum number of elements that the buffer can hold.
 *
 * @details
 * - Allocates memory for the buffer
 * - Initializes the following internal state:
 *   - `buffer_size`: Set to N, representing the capacity of the buffer.
 *   - `buffer_cnt`: Initialized to 0, tracking the current number of elements in the buffer.
 *   - `buffer_first` and `buffer_last`: Both initialized to 0, used as indices to manage the
 *     circular buffer logic.
 * - Sets up thread synchronization
 *
 * @note
 * - Ensure that the corresponding destructor properly frees the allocated memory and destroys
 *   the synchronization primitives to avoid resource leaks.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * BoundedBuffer<int> buffer(100);  // Creates a bounded buffer for 100 integers.
 * @endcode
